<b><i>Hi! I'm Jordan and I enjoy solving problems.</i></b>

I'm a Masters Physics graduate and have been working in various technical
roles for a few years now.
A lot of my day-to-day work involves programming, and it's a skill that
I've developed through many hours of training and practice.
The process of - boiling down a real-world problem into its most basic
form, having a long think about how to solve it, and then writing the
code - is something that's becoming second nature to me, and a process I
actively enjoy doing.

Like many other programmers/ developers/ engineers I also enjoy doing a
lot of coding outside of work.
I enjoy learning; new libraries, new languages, and new technology.
I'm passionate how I can use technology and develop code to solve my own
everyday problems, but also use the versatility of it to solve some of
the biggest problems in; Science, Business, and everything in between.

For me, learning programming is a continuous process.
It's frustrating and challenging sometimes, but incredibly rewarding
when I make it out the other side.
I think this quote [(from here)](https://hackernoon.com/an-open-letter-to-less-experienced-developers-c33c16ea5e88)
sums it up pretty well:

<i>"Coding for a living is learning for a living.
If you donâ€™t like learning every single day, turn back now, or try and
get a jump over into something less demanding from a learning
perspective."</i>
