<b><i>Hi! I'm Jordan and I enjoy solving problems.</i></b>

I'm a Masters Physics graduate and have been working in various technical
roles for a few years now.
A lot of my day-to-day work involves programming, and it's a skill that
I've developed through many hours of training and practice.
The process of - boiling down a real-world problem into its most basic
form, having a long think about how to solve it, and then writing the
code - is something I've become accustomed to and actively enjoy doing.

Like many other programmers/ developers/ engineers I also enjoy doing a
lot of coding outside of work.
I enjoy learning new libraries, new languages, and new technology.
I'm passionate how I can use technology and develop code to solve my own
everyday problems, but also the versatility of it to solve some of the
biggest problems in; science, business, and everything in between.
