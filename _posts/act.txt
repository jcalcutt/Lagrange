## Intro
All the plots/code (and a bit more) are available to view and use for yourself[here](link)


## First steps
The XML contains a fair bit of 'junk', so converting to a nice, clean CSv to load into a pandas dataframe is necessary but would take a bit of time.
Since I was time constrained, I found this script ... which did all the laborious work in a few seconds.
Now for the fun part!

## Something more quantitative

So far, a lot of the analysis and insight from the data has been fairly qualitative.
As the weekend was drawing to a close, for my final bit of insight, I wanted to look into the numbers.

For this, I moved back to the 'sleep' hours per day data - which I used in the initial plot.
Previously, I plotted every single day, distinguishing only between weekdays and weekends.


Using the associated date, I grouped by each day of the week, taking the mean and interquartile ranges for the sleep time value.
For the final plot I used the Seaborn library. 
Personally, I find Seaborn more straightforward to use than Matplotlib and the end result looks a lot more visually appealing too.

### Statistical view of 2017 sleep

So here, I'm able to see that there is significant differences with regards to the amount of sleep I get for different days of the week.
For example, ...
From this I can consciously try to improve my sleep patterns, such as try and even out the sleep I get on weekedays.

### wrap-up

So there we have it.
Personally, I found this little project really interesting.
Specifically because I was investigating personal data that I have unwittingly collected about myself for the last ~2.5 years.
I'm well aware there's a lot more I could do with this.
For now though, that will have to wait for another rainy weekend!

If you found this interesting, all my code is available to see (and use) in this github repo.
Simply clone the directory, add your activity CSV data into the data folder (having converted from XML), and run the jupyter notebook (With python 3, and any other dependencies).

Let me know how you get on and I welcome any advice/improvements!
