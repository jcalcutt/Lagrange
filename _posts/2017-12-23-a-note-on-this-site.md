I've built this site using Jekyll as the framework and the hosting
capability of Github pages.
This is great as it allows me <i>full</i> control of many things,
including all the html and css code. I can also run and test any updates
I make locally, before pushing my updates to github - where the site is
hosted for the outside world to view. Here, I'll briefly describe a few
of the intricacies involved in setting up, modifying and maintaining
this site.
