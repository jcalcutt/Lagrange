Hi! I’m Jordan

This is the place where I’ll write up my: thoughts, ideas and answers to
(random) questions I think up.
Most of the content will be based upon the code I write - trying to
find a happy medium between technical detail and readability - whilst
also telling a story of something (hopefully) fairly meaningful.

I’m currently working as a data engineer - developing solutions to
business problems - using a wide range of open (and some closed) source
tools.
When I’m not sat behind a computer I can usually be found outside on my
bike.

Any opinions I may express here are entirely my own and do not reflect
on my employer.
