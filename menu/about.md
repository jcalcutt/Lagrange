I'm going to use this bit of space to write about my side-projects.

I tend to do a fair bit of programming/ 'other nerdy stuff' outside of work, so I'll use this space mostly to keep
track of my own mini side-projects.

If some of this is insightful to anybody else - excellent - if not, at least it helps me keep track of of my own work
<i>...That was supposed to be a disclaimer.</i>

I have a fair bit of content half-finished outside of github and plenty of other ideas, so it'll only be a matter of
time before I add more material. When I get this properly up-and-running I'll aim to add new stuff fairly regularly. I
think one every month or two is a good target to aim for.

For now though, you can expect some posts along the lines of:

- Python-based data engineering tasks
- Machine learning and natural language processing in Python
- Writing batch scripts and files to schedule jobs
- Python plotting with matplotlib, seaborn and folium
- Bokeh interactive visualisations
- Storing data in a no-sql database, such as MongoDB
- Random hacks

There's no end of better places out there for tutorials etc, but I want to make some original content, not just slightly
modify somebody else's posts and pass it off as my own. Therefore, there'll probably be some errors, which is great, as
I can learn how not to make them again and work out better methods on how to do things.
