Hi!

This is the place I post some of my thoughts and ideas. Most of the content is  focused around code, but I’m always trying to find a happy medium between technical detail and readability. Hopefully, you’ll find some stuff here interesting and/or fairly meaningful.

I enjoy learning and finding insight that’s not immediately obvious. When I’m not sat behind a computer I can usually be found outside on my bike.
