I'm going to use this bit of space to write about my side-projects.

I tend to do a fair bit of programming/ 'other nerdy stuff' outside of
work, so I'll use this space mostly to keep track of my own mini
side-projects.

I have a fair bit of content half-finished outside of github and plenty
of other ideas, so it'll only be a matter of time before I add more
material.
When I get this properly up-and-running I'll aim to add new stuff fairly
regularly.

For now though, you can expect some posts along the lines of:

- Python-based data engineering tasks
- Machine learning and natural language processing in Python
- Writing batch scripts and files to schedule jobs
- Python plotting with Matplotlib, Seaborn and Folium
- Bokeh interactive visualisations
- Storing data in a no-sql database, such as MongoDB
- Random hacks

There's no end of better places out there for tutorials etc, but I want
to make some original content, not just slightly modify somebody else's
code and pass it off as my own.
